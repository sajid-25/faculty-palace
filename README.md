AssessIQ is a Next.js assessment auditing workspace with PostgreSQL-backed role authentication.

## Run locally

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
2. Start PostgreSQL and initialize the users and sessions tables:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

The seeded demo accounts all use the password `AssessIQDemo123!`:

| Role | Email |
| --- | --- |
| Department Head | `sarah.rahman@institution.edu` |
| Course Instructor | `arjun.mehta@institution.edu` |
| External Examiner | `david.chen@external-board.edu` |

Authentication uses PostgreSQL `users` and `sessions` tables, bcrypt password hashes, and an HTTP-only session cookie. The browser does not store the logged-in user as an authentication source.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
